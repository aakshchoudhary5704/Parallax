To achieve a parallax effect using JavaScript, you essentially need to capture the user's scroll position, then apply different translation values to various elements on your page based on that scroll position, creating the illusion of depth by making some elements move faster or slower than others as the user scrolls; this is done by manipulating CSS properties like "transform: translateX/Y" with JavaScript based on the scroll position, with each element having a "depth" value that determines its scrolling speed. 

HTML Structure: 
Create separate HTML elements (divs) for each layer of your parallax design, with each layer containing its respective image or content. 
Assign unique identifiers or classes to these layers for easy manipulation with JavaScript. 
CSS Styling: 
Position each layer absolutely within its container to allow for precise positioning and layering. 
Set background images for each layer if necessary. 
JavaScript Logic: 
Event Listener: Add an event listener to the window to capture the scroll event (usually window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {...}). 
Get Scroll Position: Inside the event listener, retrieve the current scroll position using window.scrollY. 
Calculate Movement: For each parallax layer, calculate the desired movement based on the scroll position and a "depth" value assigned to that layer (usually a multiplier). 
Apply Transformation: Use the transform: translateX/Y CSS property to move each layer based on the calculated movement, updating it on each scroll event.
